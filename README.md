#  AngularJS - V - Routing with UI-Router
### UI-Router changes your application views based on state of the application and not just the route URL.

### Student will have produced:
* An example with 3 routes that each resolve their own data
* Resolve dependency injections from a server

### Learning Objectives

* Students will understand the methodology behind routing and templating
* Students will be able to set up a basic routing system with multiple views and controllers using UI-Router
* Students will be able to use resolve to resolve data and pass in data to their controller before their
  controller initializes
* Students will be able to use stateParams to gather data from the URL

## Why would you want routing in an Angular application?
* shareable links (deep linking)
* separation of concerns in your application
* more robust, complex applications
* views and routes aren't tied down to the site URL
* even if the URL doesn't change the parts of your site will re-route to the new view
