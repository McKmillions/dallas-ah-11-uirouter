• Resolve dependency injections from a server

### Learning Objectives

• Students will understand the methodology behind routing and templating
• Students will be able to set up a basic routing system with multiple views and controllers using UI-Router
• Students will be able to use resolve to resolve data and pass in data to their controller before their
  controller initializes
• Students will be able to use stateParams to gather data from the URL

### UI-Router Intro
UI-Router changes your application views based on state of the application and not just the route URL.

## Benefits
With this approach, your views and routes aren’t tied down to the site URL. This way, you can change the parts of your site using your routing even if the URL does not change.
